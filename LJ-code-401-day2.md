## Python 401 day two
playlist today - Smokey Robinson(greatest hits) and Eagles(Hotel Calif)

finished last nights reading this morning.  There was a lot since it was a double up of two days reading. So far the Big-O reading and pod cast is jsut a concept that isnt really jelling.  My hope is that with some practical use, it will stick better. 

#Lecture
covered testing,  big "O", code review and white boarding. Testing is going to have a steep learning curve.  Big "O" not so much.

#White Board
Team of 4.  Has its pluses and negatives. Group mind helped.  committee mind not so much.  Still need to create repo.

#Lab 
Work went better today.  A lot more productive but still ran quite late. Feel like I have a better handle on what we are doing but still not sure I could figure it out on my own.  A lot more collaborative today.
