## Python 401 day two
playlist today - Smokey Robinson(greatest hits) and Eagles(Hotel Calif)

finished last nights reading this morning.  There was a lot since it was a double up of two days reading. So far the Big-O reading and pod cast is jsut a concept that isnt really jelling.  My hope is that with some practical use, it will stick better.
