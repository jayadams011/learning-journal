##Reading
Lots of reading this morning.  Need to go back saturday and review it some more.  maybe not, after lecture. We will see. 

## lecture
Todays lecture was not a great experiance.  Pretty much whited out everything Scott went over. 

##White board
In white board was able to follow along and even contribute, but didtn do too well with code.  Had to get a lot of help. 

## Lab
for Lab, the first 3 hours, my partner felt the need to refactor a lot of our code and work on re-submits. did a lot of work not wanting input. toward the end was more open to input.  I started on work on todays  "class" creation, but had to keep the code in seperate file for copy and paste to main file later.  Also had to guess at function,var and element names as I could see what we were currently using. 

toward the end we worked together.  Once i pulled down the current code, I pated in the changes I worked on and pushed it up. Hopefully tomorrow we can pull it all together.

## notes
I slacked alex to try and set up a tutor I can meet with this weekend.  Gonna need help with re-submits and reviewing the first week so I can get my grade back up and keep up.
