## Python 401 day one
playlist today - Fleetwood Mac - Rumors and Tusk

Started the day with Brandy laying down the law and setting expectatons for the next 10 weeks and beyond.  Mostly setting frame of mind, treat everyone nice! Work on myself and my future. 

Next up Scott.  Went over next 10 weeks and expectations. First team assigned. Went over white boarding  and the rest of what we will be doing. Looks like this will have a lot more job prep then previously. 

Then we went over expectations of todays lab and were assigned partners for the week. 

# Lab
Worked on Lab with Peter Kim as my paretner. We were the last ones done, but I feel pretty good with what we did and I feel like I contributed almost equally. Still not thinking like a programmer but closer.
