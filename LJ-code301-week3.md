## WEEK Three
Week three of 301 is kicking my butt.  Yesterday I found myself increasingly lost.  Today I think I might be having a full out fugue state melt down.  Melodramatic i know but thats what it feels like.  I flat out cannot remember the lab from Monday which i think would be beneficial to what we are doing today.  I went back in and worked on it to get my gears turning again.  With some help and then going through my code line by line I was able to get it working and resubmitted.  I am frustrated that I was told I needed to manually enter the data into the data base when i know that no one in lab did that, but once I got past that, I was able to dig in and find the p;laces we didnt complete our code. dont ask me how. My lab partner didnt seem to interested in working on finishing this and is mia in class today.  I will let him know it is working so he can resubmit. 

I am on a pretty good team for the book list project, but we all seem to be lost with little on nop synergy to get it mvoing forward.  I hope to rewatch the lecture videos tonight to see if it will jar something loose so  we can get back on track tomorrow. 

My tutor hasnt been repsonding to messages.  One it cuased some worry but tow alos osme frustration as I really think I could use some MAJOR help right about now.  Today I messaged him in slack and included Alex - I know - dick move - but I needed a response.  He did get back to me and said scheduling wasnt going to work for him to be a tutor and he is trying to linesomeone else up for me. 

My score in class is ok, but only by the grace of google. I just did the latest quiz and was able to pull most of the answers out of my head (which shocks me)  and the rest I was able to find in reading or online. 

KATAS - some days I am able to do these all on my own.  Others get some help from others in class.  Some I have had to flat out give up and googel just to keep my grade up.  I spoke to developer from Amazon last night and he said he lives in google and to jsut get used to it. 

Well, thats where I am at.  maybe its where I am supposed to be? I'm jsut trying to survive the week at thios point.
