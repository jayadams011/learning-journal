Did the reading this morning before class.  Less to read then yesterday but not sure it stuck any better.  Wish I had time to go back a re-read it. 

Getting grades bak from Megan.  Dont know when I will be able to re-work for re-submit.  Its not like there will be TAs avaialbe to me during the weekend. 

White board challenge went better today, but unlike yesterday, i dont think the pseudo code will be as helpfull in writing the functions. Also,still not comfortable with wrting the tests and that is why my grades are down.  Gotta make the push.
