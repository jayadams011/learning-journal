Did the reading this morning before class.  Less to read then yesterday but not sure it stuck any better.  Wish I had time to go back a re-read it. 

Getting grades bak from Megan.  Dont know when I will be able to re-work for re-submit.  Its not like there will be TAs avaialbe to me during the weekend. 

White board challenge went better today, but unlike yesterday, i dont think the pseudo code will be as helpfull in writing the functions. Also,still not comfortable with wrting the tests and that is why my grades are down.  Gotta make the push.

Not enough time for lecture.  Feels like we need 30 hour days. 

Peter and I worked through lab.  I can tell he is frustrated with the pair programming so I have to humor him some, pull him out of his head some so we can work togehter. Its hard to navigate becuase he doesnt want distractions from me so I cant really see what he is doing.  Then when he gets stuck I get like 5 minutes to try to review and troubleshoot before he says "Too much time, lets go ask"  I know to him its longer becuase he has been in is head with the issue for longer but Id like to try and figure it out or at least take a shot. 
We finished about 3/4 of todays requirements.  Will have to cathc the rest on the re-submits. We are getting a better handle on it. 
We did have some minor git conflicts but figured them out. 
I have no commits today as a result but I did slack Peter roughly 1/2 of our changes today. 

Fixed yesterdays whiteboard challenge. fleshed out the tree as well. 

Have a better feel for some of the minor basics we need to submit to make our files more real world.  I am sure we are still steps away from that but getting closer.
